        <div id="thoughts">
            <p>League of Legends is a relatively old game spanning over 10 years worth of patches and changes, but you get the gist. This game is still fun and a competitive MOBA game, and that's what makes it addicting. There are tons of champions you can play as, with each having their different builds. On the earlier seasons of the game, you can have off-meta builds for different champions, but now you can only have a better time in the game following other people's "META" builds. In that way, there little to no variety in how builds work for certain champions. But that's still tolerable because, at the end of the day, it's still a team-based game, and your chances of winning depends on the composition of your team against the enemy's.</p>
            <p>In terms of gameplay, compared to DoTA/ Dota 2, it feels way more fast paced and responsive. In addition, it feels way faster to end the game, generally speaking, around 20-40 minutes of gameplay on average. League also has a simpler UI and game mechanics compared to that of Dota 2, which has a steeper learning curve. Since, it's commonly 5v5 you can invite up to four other friends to play with, if you have friends, and it makes the game overall more fun to play.</p>
            <p>The moment you start getting used to the ropes, the more you'd feel like you want to improve. Starting out, you feel comfortable playing casually, but there's also a way to test your skills in ranked games. And then you enter the competitive scene, where you rank up the ladders to higher ranks and show off as a badge of your hard earned work (unless your bronze and below cuz that isn't a rank to be proud of). Although simple, grinding through ranked games is very hard if you don't have friends you can trust to play with. As solo queuing is a hurdle in and of itself. From my experience, I started playing since mid season 4, but I never really took ranked seriously so I don't have much to say about that.</p>
            <img src="assets/images/league-tiers.png" alt="A spreadout overview of League of Legends' ranked tiers" class="img-thumbnail mx-auto d-block my-5" width="740px">
            <p>Overall, League of Legends is still one of the most available games whenever you just want to kill some time or play competitively wherever you are as long as you have a PC and an internet. This game for me, is best played casually with friends, because that's what I have been doing for almost all of my games. The pros and cons that I will be listing will vary depending from person to person, because to each their own in this game.</p>
