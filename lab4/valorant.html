            <p>Valorant is a game I played during its launch after beta. Since I was into CS:GO before playing this, I had, for the most part, experience that helped me understand the fundamentals of how Valorant is played. Basically, no sprinting movements, you run faster with your knife out, and you also need to stop before you shoot to be accurate. Throw into these agents with abilites that offer tactical utilities (except for Raze) then BAM! you have Valorant.</p>
            <p>Valorant has its own style when it comes to its design and how its portrayed. You know, the look of non-photorealistic, cartoony, and 2D flat style. Just by looking at it for the first time, it's one of the things you'll definitely notice. Making a quick search on the internet, I found out that it's a stylized art called 'cel shading'. It's really a plus thing to have that because you see it having a sense of identity and uniqueness. Compare that to CS:GO that has a realistic, and desaturated feel.</p>
            <p>Its gunplay is one of the most satisfying aspects that will hook you into the game. Just the feeling of getting multi-kills or landing unbelievable headshots gives you a rush. It's also that moment where you or your teammates scream after a successful 'big-brain' or 'high-IQ' play. Add also the the game's high skill ceiling, which really make this game that much addicting. Since this game is still reIatively new, its esports scene has yet to create larger waves, and I'm looking forward to see more plays made by professionals in the future.</p>
            <p>This game is by far, an easier version of Counter-Strike... a toned-down yet still fun version at that. Is that a good thing? Well, yes and no. Valve's CS already offers one of the beloved FPS titles out there, and Riot taking inspiration from it is a good move because it inherits the good things from CS and then expands upon using its own quirks. Its like taking a working formula and thinking of another way to go about it. Its great to have competition, because before Valorant, CS was the only title that offered clean and precise gunplay, and right now, both games seem to be improving in their own rights.</p>
            <p>In the end, I think that Valorant is a fantastic game, albeit very competitive and becomes toxic very quickly if you talk smack. In my opinion, when I play ranked games, Valorant becomes perpetually stress-inducing and less fun. So yeah, I used to play this seriously but now I'm very lax and casual about it, and only play this when my friends invite me out or I invite them, which happens only on rare occasions. </p>
